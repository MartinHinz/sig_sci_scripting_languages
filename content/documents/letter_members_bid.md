title: "Letter to the members of the SIG"

Dear colleagues,

You are receiving this message because you are listed on the mailing list as a potential member of a CAA Special Interest Group (SIG) 'Scientific Scripting Languages in Archaeology'.

This year at the CAA 2020 in Oxford we will submit a bid to have this group accepted as an official SIG of the CAA. In a preliminary enquiry to the CAA, we were told that we should illustrate in the bid that we already have support, preferably by compiling a list of archaeologists expressing their interest in the new SIG. 

You already informed us, that you were sympathetic to such a SIG, but we would appreciate it if you could explicitly express your support of the attached bid to us as well, if you are so inclined. Only then we will include your name in the respective list. 

For the bid Sophie Schmidt, Clemens Schmid and Martin Hinz volunteer to act as coordinators. Once the bid has been accepted, a democratic process will be initiated to decide on the appointment of the coordinators. We hope that this meets with your approval.

Thank you very much for your support!

With best regards

Sophie C. Schmidt, Martin Hinz and Clemens Schmid
