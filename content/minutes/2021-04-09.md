### 3.1. Little Minions, http://littleminions.link/ 

- working group: 
    - Moritz Mennenga, Lower Saxony Institute for Historical Coastal Research, Germany 
    - Ronald Visser, Saxion University of Applied Sciences, NL 
    - Florian Thiery, RÃ¶misch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz, Germany

- Little Minion sessions (slides for presentation: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4575155) : 
    - present little tools, programs, hard-ware devices, scripts that a digital archaeologists would create to make life easier in the digital workflow
    - aims: 
        - Research Software should be made more visible
        - shared tools may help others (open source is preferred, but closed source is accepted!)
    -  some examples of tools:
        - bibliography in Wikimedia Universe
        - text mining
        - meta tool for creating triples
        - 3D pottery documentation in the field
        - profilAAR
    - small prepared contributions and spontanous "stand up minions" 

- discussion:
    - overlap of Little Minions with the aims of SIG SSLA: 
        - most of the tools on the website are scripts, but not all
        - compatible philosophies (showing tools not just results, preferring open source)
        
    - Little Minions projects are already in Zack and Joes OpenArchaeo list
    
    - Little Minions remain open to non-scripting topics, but are happy to collaborate and support
        
    - how can we join forces and support each other?
          - CAA conference 2021:   
            - SIG SSLA people can join Minion sessions spontanously (there is always time for spontanous contributions in the session)
            - advertise the other groups session in your session (and hope we don't overlap)
        - CAA conference 2022: 
            - create a session together
            - SIG SSLA people can present at Little Minions
                - a Minion talk is a lightening talk, it doesn't count as a "full paper", therefore it doesn't "take away" a main-author slot
        - on our websites: Link to each other
        - A heartfelt invite to the members ofthe Little Minion group to join the SIG
            - a lot of the minion projects have QGIS-extensions and Python programming, expertise the SIG SSLA lacks atm

### 3.2 News

- Rstudio Visual Editor: 
    - zotero integration is very easy. Type the @-Symbol and it will search your zotero - library and adds the reference to the bib-file in your project. Very efficient and easy to use.
    - doesn't work in xaringian 
    - adds markers to numbered headings, may surprise
- distill Rmarkdown template: 
    - https://rstudio.github.io/distill/
    - looks very nice and much nicer than the usual html - output

### 3.3 news on the working group Ordination and chronology ?

- not at the moment, Martin vows to do something. 

## any other business?
