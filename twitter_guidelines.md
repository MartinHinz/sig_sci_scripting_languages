## Twitter Guidelines

We can collect here what we would like to use Twitter for:

* dissemination of new packages, releases etc.
* dissemination of actions planned by the SIG

* point of contact for outsiders

curation: 

* rolling by a team of volunteers
* gathering of ideas by all members of the SIG
